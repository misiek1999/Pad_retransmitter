# Getting Help for Bluepad32

http://tinyurl.com/bluepad32-help


TL;DR:

Help us help you by providing:

* Which Bluepad32 platform you are using, and version.
* Which ESP32 module you are using. Add link if possible
* Which controller you are using, including controller firmware version. Add link if possible.
* Which sketch you are using. 
* Which Operating System you are using
* Debug log
* Post question on our [Discord server][discord_server]

## Platforms

Bluepad32 supports different platforms, like:

* Arduino IDE for ESP32 modules
* Arduino IDE for NINA co-processors, like the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect
* Arduino + ESP-IDF
* CircuitPython for AirLift co-processors
* Unijoysticle
* MightyMiggy

So, provide the platform you are using, and the version. And also which Bluepad32 version!

E.g: I'm using Arduino IDE v2.0.9 with Bluepad32 v3.7.3

## ESP32 Module

Not all modules are created equal.

Which ESP32 Module are you using ? Provide a link to the device.

E.g: I'm using Sparkfun Thing Plus - ESP32 WROOM: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17381

## Controllers

Not all controllers behave the same way... some are reliable... some not.

The officially supported controllers are enumerated here:

* [Supported gamepads][supported_gamepads]
* [Supported mice][supported_mice]

Please provide: brand, model, firmware and link to the device (if applicable).
Also mention whether or not it is genuine or a knock-off.

E.g: I'm using a genuine Nintendo Switch JoyCon using FW 3.72.

If you are using a controller that is not listed ther, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!

But if you really want us to support a gamepad that is not listed there, contact us (Send us a Private Message in Discord channel). They way it works is:

* You send us a link the the gamepad that is not supported, like the Amazon link.
* You send us via PayPal the cost of the gamepad + shipping.
* We purchase it and we will do our best to support it. But we don't guarantee anything... so many things can go wrong... especially with low-cost clones where many features are not implemented.

## Sketch

Share your sketch.

But share with us the smallest sketch that reproduces the bug. Remove all the things that are not related to Bluepad32.

Copy & paste your sketch in services like: http://gist.github.com

DO NOT COPY your sketch on Discord. It is difficult to read it there.

E.g.: The sketch that I'm using is in this URL (add link).

## Operating System

Are you using Windows, macOS, Linux ? Which version ?

E.g.: I'm using macOS 12.6.7

## Debug log

Copy & paste the output from the serial console, and share it with us.

Use services like: http://gist.github.com

Attaching an screenshot might be useful, but the screenshot is not a replacement of the Debug Log.

E.g.: The console output can be found on this link (add link).
